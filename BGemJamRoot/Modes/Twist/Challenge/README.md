`README.md - Challenge mode`

Challenge mode was originally a mode in Bejeweled Twist that contained 13 planets, each with 7 challenge levels (91 levels total)

I have remastered this mode for this matching game, with improvements such as:

> * More challenge worlds
> * More than 7 challenges per world
> * Challenges can be replayed

Some new challenges include:

1. Locktwist - A set of challenges relating to unlocking/matching locked gems
2. Doomsday - A set of challenges set around the doom gem

Previous challenges include:

1. Detonator
2. Spectrum
3. Coal mine
4. Chain reaction
5. Gem fall
6. Preserver
7. Firestorm
8. Stratamax
9. Arsenol
10. Bonanza
11. Survivor
12. Voltage
13. Enigma

This directory contains all the challenge mode levels for BGemJam.
