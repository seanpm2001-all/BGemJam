"""
The pixel stretcher script is the games engine on stretching and un-stretching the graphics so the game can easily switch between a low resolution (example: 256x144) to a high resolution (example: 30720x17280) and vice versa with little issue (other than a little bit of lag while switching of course, it won't be perfect on the first try)
This script is still highly incomplete.
